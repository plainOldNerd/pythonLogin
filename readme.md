I started this because I was helping a university student friend to program a login page (they're less than confident with programming logic).

Their teammate chose Python for the whole project, but then my friend was allowed to use another language and so they did.
I decided to take the opportunity to learn a little Python (which was recommended to me by a recruiter in a phone interview), and brush up on SQL a little.
Security (encrypton of passwords, etc) is not a concern for this project!

To run this you will need to create a DB (with the provided credentials). I used phpMyAdmin running XAMPP. Change any lines referencing computer system paths (there's one in the do_GET method I believe) to whatever suits your own computer.
The rest should be fairly obvious or easy to figure out.

- I've learnt that in Python true and false are not automatically understood, while True and False (note the uppercase first letters!) are! What a pain in the a**e!!
- "switch" seems to be replaced by "match". The break statement is not needed in Python because Python assumes as much (which I don't like, since deliberately ignoring a break has its usages, such as summing up or things which chronologically follow one another).
There may be a match one of (...) concept but I haven't looked that far.
And the default case is simply an underscore.
- It seems that class extension is done via brackets in the class definition.
i.e. instead of "class B extends class A" in Java, for example, it is simply
"class B(A):"
