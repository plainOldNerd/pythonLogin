I started this because I was helping a university student friend to program a login page (they're less than confident with programming logic).

Their teammate chose Python for the whole project, but then my friend was allowed to use another language and so they did.
I decided to take the opportunity to learn a little Python (which was recommended to me by a recruiter in a phone interview), and brush up on SQL a little.
Security (encrypton of passwords, etc) is not a concern for this project!

I've learnt that in Python true and false are not automatically understood, while True and False (note the uppercase first letters!) are! What a pain in the a**e!!
