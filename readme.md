I started this because I was helping a university student friend to program a login page (they're less than confident with programming logic).

Their teammate chose Python for the whole project, but then my friend was allowed to use another language and so they did.
I decided to take the opportunity to learn a little Python (which was recommended to me my a recruiter in a phone interview), and brush up on SQL a little.
